Welcome to your Expo app! 👋 This powerful starter template is designed to kickstart your next React Native project with Expo. Pre-configured with **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and a robust development workflow, it's perfect for building scalable cross-platform applications.

---

## **🛠 Features**

- **Expo Router**: Simplified file-based routing.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Enforced code quality and consistency.
- **Jest**: Setup for comprehensive testing.
- **State Management**: Future-ready for Zustand with LocalStorage.
- **Cross-Platform**: Build apps for iOS, Android, and Web effortlessly.

## **📖 Get Started**

1. **Install dependencies**

   You can use either **npm** or **bun** to install the project dependencies:

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using bun:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

     ```bash
   bun start
   ```

3. **Explore development options**
   After starting the app, you can choose from the following options:
   - Open the app in a [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - Use an [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - Try the app in an [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - Test with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

## **🔄 Get a Fresh Project**

Want to reset your project? Run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

```bash
bun run reset-project
```

This command moves the starter code to the **app-example** directory and sets up a blank **app** directory for fresh development.

---

## **📂 Project Structure**

Your project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/). Start developing by editing files in the **app** directory.

```
root/
├── app/                # Your app screens and components
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts like reset-project
├── node_modules/       # Dependencies
├── package.json        # Project configuration
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```
